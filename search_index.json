For the quadratic transport cost, estimates will be given in terms of weak-dependent coefficients that are well suited to a large class of dependent sequences. This class includes irreducible Markov chains, dynamical systems generated by intermittent maps or strong mixing sequences. We will also present very recent results in the independent framework for a broader class of convex costs that includes quadratic cost as a special case but also certain logarithmic costs such as \\(|x| \\ln (1+ |x|)\\).

In this talk, we review recent progress with respect to a class of reaction-diffusion stochastic particle systems on an \\(n\\)-dimensional lattice. In such a process, particles can move across sites as well as be created/annihilated according to diffusion and reaction rates. These rates will be chosen so that there are two preferred particle mass density levels \\(a_1\\), \\(a_2\\). In the evolution, one may understand, when the diffusion and reaction schemes are appropriately scaled, that a rough interface forms between the regions where the mass density is close to \\(a_1\\) or \\(a_2\\). Via notions in the theory of hydrodynamic limits, we discuss when the scaled limit of the particle mass density field in \\(n\\geq 2\\) is a sharp interface flow by mean-curvature. We also discuss the fluctuation field limit of the mass near the forming interface, which informs on the approach to the continuum view in a certain stationary regime in \\(n=1,2\\).

Since its introduction by Lawler in the 1980s, the scaling limits of LERW have been thoroughly studied. While these limits are well-understood in dimensions two, four, and higher, the three-dimensional case continues to present unique challenges.

In this work, we propose and study the stochastic Euler dynamics – a continuous-time Markov process that is equivalent to a linear spline interpolation of a random timestep (forward) Euler method. We understand the stochastic Euler dynamics as a path-valued ansatz for the ODE solution that shall be approximated. We first obtain qualitative insights by studying deterministic Euler dynamics which we derive through a first order approximation to the infinitesimal generator of the stochastic Euler dynamics. In the context of linear ODEs, these determinstic Euler dynamics describe the dynamics of the expectation of the stochastic Euler dynamics. Then we show convergence of the stochastic Euler dynamics to the ODE solution by studying the associated infinitesimal generators and by a novel local truncation error analysis. Next we prove stability by an immediate analysis of the random timestep Euler method and by deriving Foster–Lyapunov criteria for the stochastic Euler dynamics; the latter also yield bounds on the speed of convergence to stationarity. The paper ends with a discussion of second-order stochastic Euler dynamics and a series of numerical experiments that appear to verify our analytical results.

In nonhomogeneous environments, such as aqueous two-phase systems or biological condensates with different diffusion coefficients in different phases, the solution to a Langevin equation is not unique unless the interpretation of stochastic integrals involved is selected. We analyse the diffusion of particles in such systems and evaluate the mean, the mean square displacement, and the distribution of particles, as well as the variance of the time-averaged mean-squared displacements \\([1]\\). We provide solutions as a function of the interpretation parameter \\(\\alpha\\), with particular attention to the Itô, Stratonovich, and Hänggi-Klimontovich interpretations, revealing fundamentally different behaviours. Furthermore, heterogeneous diffusion is also considered when the particle is subjected to an external force. Our analytical results provide a method to choose the interpretation parameter from single particle tracking experiments. Bibliography \\([1]\\) A. Pacheco-Pozo, M. Balcerek, A. Wyłomańska, K.

Finite-velocity random motions governed by a modified Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation Barbara Martinucci (University of Salerno) We study a modified Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation, whose solution is the probability density function of a non-homogeneous telegraph process \\((X_t)_{t\\geq 0}\\). The latter starts its motion with velocity \\(c&gt;0\\) and is characterized by velocity changes governed by a non-homogeneous Poisson process with intensity function \\(\\lambda(t)=\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{t}}\\), \\(\\alpha&gt;0\\), \\(t&gt;0\\). We determine the Cauchy problem for the characteristic function of \\(X_t\\) and solve it by making use of a suitable transformation which leads to a one-dimensional Schr\\(\\ddot{o}\\)dinger-type differential equation. The solution of such equation, which, to the best of our knowledge, is unknown in the literature, is obtained by means of the Frobenius method and provides a closed form expression of the characteristic function of \\(X_t\\). We also disclose the probability law of \\(X_t\\) and study its main features. Finally, under Kac’s-type scaling conditions, it is shown that the characteristic function of \\(X_t\\) tends to that of a scaled self-similar centered Gaussian process with variance proportional to \\(t^{3/2}\\).

Formally speaking, we observe a sequence of random variables and have to decide when we must stop, given that there is no recall allowed, that is, a random variable once rejected cannot be chosen later on; for further details, see \\([1]\\). Our decision to stop depends on the observations already made, but does not depend on the future which is not yet known. In this talk, we will give an overview of discrete-time problems when at least two stops are required. Bibliography \\([1]\\) Sofronov, G., &amp; Szajowski, K. (2025).

Multiple Stopping Porosinski’s Problem Aiko Kurushima (Sophia University) We consider the multiple stopping version of the full-information best choice problem with a random number of observations. The single stopping case was previously solved by Porosinski (1987), who addressed the problem of maximizing the probability of selecting the overall maximum from a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from the uniform distribution. He derived the optimal stopping rule under certain assumptions on the distribution of the random horizon.In this talk, we extend the setting to allow multiple stopping opportunities. We explore the conditions on the distribution required for optimality and present an optimal multiple stopping strategy under a stronger assumption on the distribution.

These markets have experienced strong development in recent years and are currently experimented at the highest level by regulation authorities, in particular in Europe and in USA. In this context of large market fragmentation, the consensus \"market price\" is then challenging to evaluate. We will present how the use of median (weighted with volumes and/or times) emerge as a key ingredient for robust aggregation: for such medians, I will show how we can derive relevant sub-gamma concentration-of-measure inequalities. Then, since this consensus \"market price\" can serve as a reference for derivatives pricing, I will investigate how it can be hedged by studying its Malliavin differentiability properties.

Stochastic filtering equations for diffusions on infinite graphs Tomoyuki Ichiba (University of California Santa Barbara) We shall discuss diffusions with mean-field interactions and interactions through a tree structure by introducing stochastic differential equations with distributional constraints. This class of system includes a system of directed chain stochastic differential equations, and it has an infinite-dimensional feature and so does the corresponding system of filtering equations we discuss. We also discuss approximations of the system by particle systems to determine the distributions and its application for portfolio optimization.  Convergence Analysis of Real-time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) for a class of Recurrent Neural Networks Konstantinos Spiliopoulos (Boston University) Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are commonly trained with the truncated backpropagation-through-time (TBPTT) algorithm. For the purposes of computational tractability, the TBPTT algorithm truncates the chain rule and calculates the gradient on a finite block of the overall data sequence. Such approximation could lead to significant inaccuracies, as the block length for the truncated backpropagation is typically limited to be much smaller than the overall sequence length. In contrast, Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) is an online optimization algorithm which asymptotically follows the true gradient of the loss on the data sequence as the number of sequence time steps t→∞. RTRL forward propagates the derivatives of the RNN hidden/memory units with respect to the parameters and, using the forward derivatives, performs online updates of the parameters at each time step in the data sequence. RTRL’s online forward propagation allows for exact optimization over extremely long data sequences, although it can be computationally costly for models with large numbers of parameters. We prove convergence of the RTRL algorithm for a class of RNNs. The convergence analysis establishes a fixed point for the joint distribution of the data sequence, RNN hidden layer, and the RNN hidden layer forward derivatives as the number of data samples from the sequence and the number of training steps tend to infinity. We prove convergence of the RTRL algorithm to a stationary point of the loss. Numerical studies illustrate our theoretical results. One potential application area for RTRL is the analysis of financial data, which typically involve long time series and models with small to medium numbers of parameters. This makes RTRL computationally tractable and a potentially appealing optimization method for training models. Thus, we include an example of RTRL applied to limit order book data.

Geiss and Ylinen in \\([1]\\), we investigate regularity properties of fully path-dependent stochastic differential equations. The used coupling method is robust and allows for results under minimal structural assumptions. Two cases of the coupling method are of special interest: The isotropic coupling to treat the Malliavin Sobolev space \\(\\mathbb{D}_{1,2}\\) and the related Besov spaces obtained by real interpolation, and secondly, a cut-off coupling to treat the \\(L_p\\)-variation of backward stochastic differential equations where the forward process is the investigated stochastic differential equation.

Furthermore, we show that solitons of the same type are completely correlated at the diffusive scale. This talk is based on a joint work with Stefano Olla and Makiko Sasada.

In the \\(k=1\\) case, the model is the original one, and can be solved exactly by analogy with Friedman’s urn. However, the analogy cannot be extended to the \\(k&gt;2\\) case already. In this paper we show how to treat the model for each k by analogy with the more general urn model of Hill, Lane and Sudderth. Interestingly, for \\(k&gt;2\\) we find a critical dependence from the initial conditions above certain values of the memory parameter \\(p\\), and regions of convergence with entropy that is sub-linear in the number of steps. Step Reinforced Random Walks with Regularly Varying Memory Aritra Majumdar (Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata) The Step Reinforced Random Walk (SRRW) is a generalization of the usual random walk with memory. The walker, at every epoch, chooses a past step uniformly at random; repeats it with probability \\(p\\) or innovates with probability \\(1-p\\), independent of the past. Here, \\(p\\) is called the memory parameter. The SRRW has been a subject of great interest in the last few decades, since it exhibits a phase transition from diffusive to superdiffusive behavior, based on \\(p\\) unlike the usual walk. Bertenghi and Laulin (2024) studied a variant of the SRRW in which the past step is selected with probability proportional to a weight sequence that is regularly varying of index \\(\\gamma&gt;-1\\). The innovation steps were assumed to be independent and identically distributed with finite variance. The law of large numbers and fluctuations around the large number limit have been obtained for certain values of \\(p\\in \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma+1},\\frac{\\gamma+1/2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\gamma\\geq 0\\). In this talk, we shall provide a complete picture of the limiting behavior of the random walk; the law of large numbers and functional limit theorems for all \\(p\\in[0,1]\\) and \\(\\gamma&gt;-1\\). We discuss the phase transition emerging in such a walk with novel superdiffusive scalings in the critical regime. Along with the usual \\(\\sqrt{n\\log n}\\) scale observed for the SRRW, a variety of different scalings (e.g. \\(\\sqrt{n(\\log n)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\), \\(\\sqrt{n(\\log n)^{-2}}\\), \\(\\sqrt{n\\log n\\log\\log n}\\) etc.) appear in the generalized walk. Further, depending on the scaling exponent, one can have both almost sure and weak functional limit theorems in the critical regime, in contrast to the usual SRRW where only weak limits are observed.

Radosław Wieczorek (University of Silesia in Katowice) Stochastic particle models are very common in modern mathematical modelling, especially in biology and chemistry. In the talk we consider a situation when one of the population is abundant enough to use macroscopic approximation, while the other consist of a few particles and is described by a stochastic particle system. Such a scale separation leads to the so called hybrid models, where a stochastic particle system is coupled to partial differential equation. A hybrid stochastic individual-based model of proliferating cells with chemotaxis \\([2]\\) will be presented. The model is expressed by a branching diffusion process coupled to a partial differential equation describing concentration of chemotactic factor. It is shown that in the hydrodynamic limit when number of cells goes to infinity the model converges to the solution of a nonconservative Patlak-Keller-Segel-type system. A nonlinear mean-field stochastic particle model is defined and it is proven that the movement of descendants of a single cell in the individual model converges to this mean-field process when the number of particles goes to infinity.

Law of the iterated logarithm for Markov semigroups with exponential mixing property in the Wasserstein distance Dawid Czapla (Institute of Mathematics, University of Silesia in Katowice) The main goal of this talk is to present our recent result concerning the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for non-stationary, continuous-time Markov processes on Polish spaces. Specifically, our theorem applies to additive functionals of processes governed by stochastically continuous Markov-Feller semigroups that exhibit exponential mixing and non-expansiveness in the Wasserstein metric. To state the result more precisely, let us first introduce some notation. We work on a complete, separable metric space \\((X,\\rho)\\), endowed with its Borel \\(\\sigma\\)-field \\(\\mathcal{B}(X)\\). By \\(\\mathcal{M}_1(X)\\) we denote the family of all Borel probability measures on \\(X\\), and, given any \\(r&gt;0\\), we write \\(\\mathcal{M}_{1,r}(X)\\) for the subset of \\(\\mathcal{M}_1(X)\\) consisting of those measures \\(\\mu\\) for which \\(\\int_X \\rho(x_0,x)^r\\,\\mu(dx)&lt;\\infty\\) with some \\(x_0\\in X\\). Furthermore, let us recall that the Wasserstein distance on the set \\(\\mathcal{M}_{1,1}(X)\\) is given by \\[d_W(\\mu,\\nu)=\\sup\\left\\{\\left|\\int_X f\\,d(\\mu-\\nu) \\right|:\\; f:X\\to\\mathbb{R},\\;\\,\\operatorname{Lip}f \\leq 1\\right\\}\\quad\\text{for}\\quad \\mu,\\nu\\in\\mathcal{M}_{1,1}(X),\\] where \\(\\operatorname{Lip}f:=\\sup_{x\\neq y} |f(x)-f(y)|/\\rho(x,y)\\). The object of our study is a continuous-time Markov process \\(\\Phi:=\\{\\Phi_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\), evolving on the space \\((X,\\rho)\\), with associated transition semigroup \\(\\{P_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\), consisting of Markov operators acting on \\(\\mathcal{M}_1(X)\\). Concretely, this means that \\(\\Phi\\) is a family of \\(X\\)-valued random variables on a measurable space \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal{F})\\), equipped with a collection of probability measures \\(\\{\\mathbb{P}_x\\}_{x\\in X}\\), such that, for any \\(s,t\\geq 0\\), \\(x\\in X\\), and \\(A\\in\\mathcal{B}(X)\\), \\[\\mathbb{P}_x(\\Phi_0=x)=1,\\quad \\mathbb{P}_x(\\Phi_{s+t}\\in A\\,|\\,\\mathcal{F}_s)=\\mathbb{P}_{\\Phi_s}(\\Phi_t\\in A),\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\mathbb{P}_x(\\Phi_t\\in A)=P_t\\delta_x(A),\\] where \\(\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\) is the natural filtration of \\(\\Phi\\), and \\(\\delta_x\\) denotes the Dirac measure at \\(x\\). Additionally, as usual, for every \\(\\mu\\in\\mathcal{M}_1(X)\\), we define \\[\\mathbb{P}_{\\mu}(F):=\\int_X \\mathbb{P}_x(F)\\,\\mu(dx)\\quad\\text{for}\\quad F\\in\\mathcal{F}_{\\infty}:=\\sigma(\\Phi_t:\\;s\\geq 0).\\] Clearly, \\(\\Phi\\) can be then regarded as a Markov process on \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal{F}_{\\infty},\\mathbb{P}_{\\mu})\\) with initial distribution \\(\\mu\\). Our result relies on the following assumptions: \\(\\{P_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\) is stochastically continuous, i.e., for every \\(x\\in X\\) and each bounded continuous function \\(f:X\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), the map \\([0,\\infty) \\ni t\\mapsto \\int_X f\\,d(P_t\\delta_x)\\) is continuous at \\(t=0\\). \\(\\{P_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\) is Feller, i.e., the map \\(X \\ni x\\mapsto \\int_X f\\,d(P_t\\delta_x)\\) is continuous for every bounded continuous function \\(f:X\\to\\mathbb{R}\\). There exists \\(\\gamma\\in (0,\\infty)\\) such that \\[d_W(P_t\\delta_x,\\,P_t\\delta_y)\\leq e^{-\\gamma t}\\rho(x,y)\\quad\\text{for any}\\quad t\\geq 0,\\; x,y\\in X.\\] For some \\(\\mu_0\\in\\mathcal{M}_1(X)\\), there exist \\(x_0\\in X\\) and \\(\\zeta\\in (2,\\infty)\\) such that \\[\\sup_{t\\geq 0} \\int_X \\rho(x_0,x)^{\\zeta}\\,P_t\\mu_0(dx)&lt;\\infty.\\] Under conditions (A2)-(A4), it can be shown that \\(\\{P_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\) admits a unique invariant probability measure \\(\\mu_*\\), which is a member of \\(\\mathcal{M}_{1,\\zeta}(X)\\). Let \\(g:X\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) be an arbitrary bounded Lipschitz continuous function such that \\(\\int_X g\\,d\\mu_*=0\\), and define \\[I_t(g):=\\int_0^t g(\\Psi_s)\\,ds\\quad\\text{for}\\quad t\\geq 0.\\] Moreover, put \\[\\chi_g(x)=\\int_0^{\\infty} P_t g(x)\\,dt\\quad\\text{for}\\quad x\\in X\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\sigma_g^2:=\\mathbb{E}_{\\mu_*}\\left[\\left(\\chi_g(\\Phi_1)-\\chi_g(\\Phi_0)+I_1(g) \\right)^2\\right].\\] The announced result can be now formulated as follows. Theorem. Suppose that conditions (A1)-(A4) hold. Then \\(\\sigma_g^2\\) is finite, and whenever it is positive, the process \\(\\{I_t(g)\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\) satisfies the LIL under \\(\\mathbb{P}_{\\mu_0}\\), with \\(\\sigma_g^2\\) serving as its asymptotic variance, i.e., \\[\\liminf_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{I_t(g)}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma_g^2\\, t\\ln\\ln t}}=-1 \\quad \\text{and}\\quad \\limsup_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{I_t(g)}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma_g^2 \\,t\\ln\\ln t}}=1\\;\\;\\;\\mathbb{P}_{\\mu_0}-\\text{a.s.}\\] Moreover, \\(\\sigma_g^2\\) can also be expressed as \\(\\sigma_g^2=2\\int_X g\\chi_g\\,d\\mu_*=\\lim_{t\\to \\infty}\\mathbb{E}_{\\mu_0}\\left[I_t^2(g) \\right]/t.\\) In the talk, we will discuss the techniques employed in the proof of this theorem and, if time permits, outline some of its potential applications. Basically, the proof strategy involves a reduction to the discrete-time case and a martingale-type decomposition of \\(\\Phi\\), enabling the use of \\([3, \\text{Theorem}~1]\\) (a LIL criterion for martingales). The most challenging task, however, lies in transitioning from the stationary to the non-stationary setting, which we accomplish by leveraging certain ideas from \\([1]\\). The result applies, for instance, to solution process of stochastic differential equation with dissipative drift considered in \\([4]\\), as well as to diffusion processes on \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) discussed in \\([\\text{§4.1}, 2]\\).

Hanna Wojewódka-Ściążko (University of Silesia in Katowice) This talk addresses the challenge of proving the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and the Law of the Iterated Logarithm (LIL) for a general class of continuous-time Markov processes evolving on Polish metric spaces, where the initial distribution is not assumed to be stationary. An important motivating example is the class of piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), whose deterministic parts follow continuous semiflows that are randomly switched at the jump times of a Poisson process (for a detailed description, see Section \\(7\\) of \\([1]\\)). Such models arise naturally in applications, including autoregulated gene expression (cf. \\([2]\\)). Although limit theorems for stochastic processes have been extensively studied, only a few versions are available for Markov processes on general Polish spaces, and even fewer address the non-stationary case. Regarding the CLT, perhaps the most general result to date is Theorem \\(2.1\\) in \\([3]\\). An analogous version of the LIL, albeit under slightly stronger assumptions, is given in Theorem \\(2.1\\) in \\([4]\\). Unfortunately, we have not been able to apply either of these results to the class of PDMPs with random flow switching discussed above. The main obstacle lies in our inability to verify exponential mixing in the Wasserstein distance, as required by both theorems. Instead, we are only able to establish exponential mixing in the bounded-Lipschitz (Fortet–Mourier) distance. To overcome this limitation, we have developed new versions of limit theorems that apply under weaker assumptions, specifically: a version of the CLT for nonstationary Markov-Feller processes (governed by semigroups \\(\\{P(t)\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\)) with a Polish state space \\(E\\), which are exponentially mixing in the bounded-Lipschitz distance, meaning that \\[\\begin{gathered} \\text{there exist a continuous function $V:E\\to[0,\\infty)$}\\\\ \\text{and constants $\\gamma, \\beta&gt;0$, $\\delta\\in(0,1)$ such that,}\\\\ \\text{for any Borel probability measures $\\mu$, $\\nu$ and every $t\\geq 0$}\\\\ d_{\\text{FM}}\\left(\\mu P(t),\\nu P(t)\\right)\\leq \\beta e^{-\\gamma t}\\left(\\int_E V\\;d(\\mu+\\nu)+1\\right)^{\\delta}, \\end{gathered}\\] and satisfy a continuous Foster-Lyapunov condition, i.e. \\[\\begin{gathered} \\text{there exist $A,B\\geq 0$ and $\\Gamma&gt;0$ such that}\\\\ P(t)V^2(x)\\leq Ae^{-\\Gamma t}V^2(x)+B\\quad \\text{for all}\\quad x\\in E,\\;t\\geq 0 \\end{gathered}\\] (cf. Theorem \\(3.1\\) in \\([1]\\)); a version of the LIL for a similar, though slightly narrower, class of processes. The main difference lies in replacing the exponential mixing condition with the assumption of the existence of an appropriate Markovian coupling. This type of assumption originates from \\([5]\\), and it naturally implies the exponential mixing property of the semigroup \\(\\{P(t)\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\). Both of these results will be discussed in detail during the talk. Bibliography \\([1]\\) D. Czapla, K. Horbacz, H.

The model describes the price dynamics of a financial asset by allowing its volatility to be stochastic. This is implemented through a system of two stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with appropriate initial conditions. Although the formulation of the model is relatively simple, the problem of providing a rigorous mathematical description of the solution to the associated SDEs has turned out to be surprisingly difficult and remains unsolved to this day. In our talk, we present a new approach to characterizing the probability distribution in the SABR model. To achieve this, we perform an unconventional change of probability measure — unconventional in the sense of parameter dependence — which allows us to reduce the original problem of describing the solution to the initial SDEs to analyzing the probability distribution of a certain one-dimensional diffusion process that may explode. Using the approach developed by Karatzas and Ruf \\([2]\\) for explosive diffusions, we are able to compute the power transform of the price process in the SABR model. Remarkably, we are also able to deconstruct the parameter dependencies and invert the transform, obtaining the probability distribution of the SABR model as an explicitly given functional of a Brownian motion.

Characterization of moments in the SABR model Michał Barski (University of Warsaw) In this talk, I will present a new approach to computing moments in the SABR model by reducing the original system of stochastic differential equations to a one-dimensional diffusion process with possible explosion. The central idea is to introduce an auxiliary process θ, whose negative moments are directly related to the moments of the asset price in the SABR framework. Using the specific polynomial structure of the coefficients in the SDE for θ, we derive a recursive formula for the integer moments of the asset price. This recurrence takes the form of a system of ordinary differential equations depending on the model parameters and can be solved explicitly in special parameter regimes, such as when \\(\\beta=0\\) or \\(\\rho=0\\). In the general case, the initial term of the recursion is characterized by its Laplace transform expressed as a power series. This method provides new analytical tools for studying the moment structure of the SABR model and, in many cases, leads to a unique identification of the distribution of the underlying asset price. The talk is based on a joint work with M. Wiśniewolski and B. Polaczyk. Measuring volatility: deterministic and stochastic perspectives (regularization by noise) Rafał Łochowski (Warsaw School of Economics and University of Warsaw) In the talk I will review several results on convergence of functions of sums of increments of stochastic processes or deterministic paths to limiting objects, which are known under the names like: volatility, integrated volatility, quadratic variation, \\(p\\)-variation, \\(\\psi\\)-variation etc. The emphasis will be on the sampling method used and the dependence of the existence and value of the limit on the sampling metod (partition scheme) chosen. For example, while for semimartingales the sampling method may be almost arbitrary, (though the mode of convergence may depend on the method chosen), for deterministic functions it is not the case.

The classical example of such systems is the Asymmetric (Simple) Exclusion process (ASEP), an interacting particle system whose large-scale behaviour has fascinated probabilists and mathematicians for more than half a century. In the subcritical spatial dimension d=1, the SBE coincides with the derivative of the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, which is polynomially superdiffusive and whose fluctuations are described by the KPZ Fixed Point, while in the super-critical dimensions d&gt;2, it was recently shown to be diffusive and rescale to a biased Stochastic Heat equation. The present talk focuses on the critical dimension d=2, which falls outside of the ground-breaking theory of Regularity Structures and whose large-scale behaviour had long been open. In their seminal work, van Beijren, Kutner and Spohn conjecture that the SBE should be logarithmically superdiffusive with a precise exponent but this has only been shown up to lower order corrections (both for ASEP in a landmark paper of H.-T. Yau, and, more recently for the SPDE). We pin down the logarithmic superdiffusivity exactly by identifying the asymptotic behaviour of the so-called diffusion matrix and show that, once the logarithmic corrections to the scaling are taken into account, the solution of the SBE satisfies a central limit theorem.

For this purpose, a variety of models associated with non-Hermitian operators and matrices have been extensively studied in a new research field called non-Hermitian physics. Motivated by such a new trend, we will report the stochastic analysis of non-Hermitian matrix-valued Brownian motion (BM) and related stochastic processes. In contrast to Dyson’s BM models describing the eigenvalue processes of the Hermitian matrix-valued BMs, the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of the eigenvalue processes are coupled with those of the eigenvector-overlap processes. The latter cause random time-change to the former. We also discuss non-normal and defective matrix-valued dynamical systems in order to demonstrate the importance of the notion of pseudospectra in addition to eigenvalues. This talk is based on the joint work with Syota Esaki (Oita), Satoshi Yabuoku (Fukuoka) \\([1]\\) and Jacek Małecki (Wrocław), and with Saori Morimoto (Chuo) and Tomoyuki Shirai (Kyushu) \\([2,3]\\).

The coefficients in this expansion are believed to encode fundamental information about the model, including potential-theoretic quantities, topological invariants, and conformal geometric properties \\([3,5]\\). While the first three terms in the expansion are now well understood from a mathematical perspective \\([4]\\), the full structure of the expansion remains largely open. In this talk, I will discuss non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles belonging to the complex and symplectic Ginibre symmetry classes, which can be realised as determinantal and Pfaffian Coulomb gases in the complex plane. I will present recent progress on the free energy expansions of these models, and explain how these results connect to developments in integrable probability. Bibliography \\([1]\\) S.-S. Byun, N.-G.

Collisions of the supercritical Keller-Segel particle system Yoan Tardy (CMAP (Polytechnique)) We study a particle system naturally associated to the \\(2\\)-dimensional Keller-Segel equation. It consists of \\(N\\) Brownian particles in the plane, interacting through a binary attraction in \\(\\theta /Nr\\), where \\(r\\) stands for the distance between two particles. When the intensity \\(\\theta\\) of this attraction is greater than \\(2\\), this particle system explodes in finite time. We assume that \\(N&gt;3\\theta\\) and study in details what happens near explosion. There are two slightly different scenarios, depending on the values of \\(N\\) and \\(\\theta\\), here is one: at explosion, a cluster consisting of precisely \\(k_0\\) particles emerges, for some deterministic \\(k_0\\ge 7\\) depending on \\(N\\) and \\(\\theta\\). Just before explosion, there are infinitely many \\((k_0-1)\\)-ary collisions. There are also infinitely many \\((k_0-2)\\)-ary collisions before each \\((k_0-1)\\)-ary collision. And there are infinitely many binary collisions before each \\((k_0-2)\\)-ary collision. Finally, collisions of subsets of \\(3,\\dots,k_0-3\\) particles never occur. The other scenario is similar except that there are no \\((k_0-2)\\)-ary collisions. Theorem.(partially informal) Assume that \\(\\theta \\geq 2\\), that \\(N&gt;3\\theta\\) and define \\(k_0 =\\lceil 2N/\\theta\\rceil \\in \\{ 7,\\dots N\\}\\), \\(k_1 = k_0-1\\) and \\(k_2\\in \\{k_0-1,k_0-2\\}\\) depending on \\(\\theta\\) and \\(N\\).

Our objective is to estimate the system parameters based on periodic, noisy observations of customer counts at each station. These observations are collected through a Poisson sampling process. We derive the covariance structure of the observed counts and leverage it to develop consistent estimators for the system parameters.

A common feature of these particle systems is a lack of explicit invariant measures in general. This is also the source of the key technical difficulties that are ultimately resolved by analysis of the associated Kolmogorov equations. Time permitting, we will discuss applications of the methods to related settings, such as the open KPZ equation and open ASEP. Scaling limit of half-space KPZ equation Sayan Das (University of Chicago) We consider the KPZ equation in the half-space: \\[\\partial_t\\mathcal{H} = \\frac12\\partial_x^2\\mathcal{H}+\\frac12(\\partial_x \\mathcal{H})^2+\\xi, \\quad (x,t)\\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge0}^2\\] with narrow wedge initial data and Neumann boundary condition: \\[\\partial_x\\mathcal{H}(x,t)\\mid_{x=0}=\\alpha\\] In the talk, I will discuss the process level scaling limit of \\(\\mathcal{H}(x,t)\\) as \\(t\\to \\infty\\) under the 1:2:3 KPZ scaling. This is based on a joint work with Christian Serio. On the global solutions of the KPZ fixed point Ofer Busani (University of Edinburgh) The Kardar–Parisi–Zhang (KPZ) fixed point is a fundamental random process that arises as the universal scaling limit for a broad class of 1+1-dimensional stochastic growth models. A key feature of the KPZ fixed point is the conservation of the slope of the initial condition, which prompts the natural question: for a fixed realization of the system, how many global (bi-infinite in time) solutions exist with a given slope? Previous work \\([2,1]\\) has established the existence of a “good” set of slopes for which the “one force–one solution” principle applies—namely, each such slope yields a unique global solution. However, beyond this good set, little is known. In particular, while it is known that uniqueness fails for “bad” slopes, the number and structure of these non-unique global solutions is unknown. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of global solutions to the KPZ fixed point with a prescribed slope. In particular, we show that for every bad slope, there exist infinitely many distinct global solutions. At the heart of the proof is a bijection between global solutions and certain bi-infinite interfaces.

Specifically, we consider the so-called wild bootstrap method: Let \\(w_1,\\dots,w_n\\) be i.i.d. random variables independent of the data \\(X_1,\\dots,X_n\\) such that \\(E[w_1]=0\\) and \\(E[w_1^2]=1\\).

As a corollary, we obtain the following blessing-of-dimensionality type phenomenon: Corollary.

Normal approximation for exponential random graphs Xiao Fang (The Chinese University of Hong Kong) The question of whether the central limit theorem (CLT) holds for the total number of edges in exponential random graph models (ERGMs) in the subcritical region of parameters has remained an open problem. In this paper, we establish the CLT. As a result of our proof, we also derive a convergence rate for the CLT, an explicit formula for the asymptotic variance, and the CLT for general subgraph counts. To establish our main result, we develop Stein’s method for the normal approximation of general functionals of nonlinear exponential families of random variables, which is of independent interest. In addition to ERGMs, our general theorem can also be applied to other models. A key ingredient needed in our proof for the ERGM is a higher-order concentration inequality, which was known in a subset of the subcritical region called Dobrushin’s uniqueness region. We use Stein’s method to partially generalize such inequalities to the subcritical region.

Scaling limit of dependent random walks Jeonghwa Lee (University of North Carolina Wilmington) Recently, a generalized Bernoulli process (GBP) was developed as a stationary binary sequence that can have long-range dependence, and it was further broadened to include various covariance functions. In this work, we find the scaling limits of dependent random walks that follow GBPs and the dependence structure of the limiting processes. We show that the second-type Mittag-Leffler process and exponential process arise as the limiting processes. Compound processes are considered with a Levy process subordinated to the cumulative sum in GBP, and the asymptotic properties and dependence structure of the subordinated processes are discussed. Applications of GBP are provided with datasets in economics and horticulture.

This extends the result of Fraser and Sahlsten (2018) for the Brownian motion and verifies partly the conjecture of Fraser, Orponen and Sahlsten (2014). We introduce a combinatorial integration by parts formula to compute the moments of the Fourier transform of the graph measure. The proof of our main result is based on this integration by parts formula together with Faà di Bruno’s formula and strong local nondeterminism of fractional Brownian motion.

One aspect of this research direction is centered in an interacting particle systems model, namely the Dyson Brownian motion. In the first part of the talk, I will introduce basic ideas of SLE theory, then I will describe the connection with modern techniques from Random Matrix Theory via a first application of our method. I will finish the talk with some open problems that emerge using this newly introduced toolbox. This is a joint work with A. Campbell and K. Luh.

In this project we study high exceedence probabilities of the form \\[\\mathbb{P} \\{ \\Gamma_{[0,T]} ( \\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}} ( \\boldsymbol{X} - u \\boldsymbol{b} ) ) &gt; L_u \\},\\] as \\(u \\to \\infty\\), where \\(\\Gamma_{[0,T]}\\) is a functional of a continuous \\(d\\)-dimensional Gaussian process \\(\\mathbf X(t)\\) on \\([0,T]\\), and \\(L_u\\) is some sequence of thresholds, chosen appropriately for each \\(\\Gamma\\). The class of functionals we treat is quite broad, including functionals of the form \\[\\Gamma_E ( \\boldsymbol{f} ) = \\int_{E} G ( \\boldsymbol{f} ( t ) ) \\, d t \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Gamma_{E \\times F} ( \\boldsymbol{f} ) = \\sup_{t \\in E} \\inf_{s \\in F} \\min_{i = 1, \\dots, d} f_i ( t, s ),\\] where \\(G\\) is some function satisfying additional assumptions. In particular, this class includes the classical sojourn time, Parisian (moving-window infimum) functional, area under the curve, as well as compositions of those with continuous but not necessarily linear operators. Regarding the class of the Gaussian processes, we study both stationary and non-stationary cases under the assumptions similar to those of Dȩbicki-Hashorva-Wang (2019). Key technical contributions include the extension of Pickands-type arguments to these vector-valued settings and general functionals, supported by lemmas detailing conditional process behavior, uniform convergence, and properties of the functionals themselves. The presentation will outline the main theorems, discuss the crucial assumptions, and illustrate the framework’s applicability with examples. This work provides a unified approach to understanding extreme sojourns for a broad class of Gaussian models. Extremes of Brownian decision trees Nikolai Kriukov (University of Amsterdam) We consider a Brownian motion with linear drift that splits at fixed time points into a fixed number of branches, which may depend on the branching points. For this process, which we shall refer as the Brownian decision tree, we investigate the exact asymptotics of high exceedance probabilities in finite time horizon, including: the probability that at least one branch exceeds some high threshold, the probability that the largest distance between branches gets large and the probability that all branches simultaneously exceeds some high barrier. Hitting probabilities for multivariate Brownian motion: exact asymptotics Svyatoslav Novikov (University of Lausanne) Consider the multivariate Brownian risk model driven by the \\(d\\)-dimensional Brownian motion \\(B(t), t\\geq 0\\). Classical results in the literature are concerned with the approximation of the simultaneous ruin probability, which is related to the approximation of the supremum of the process falling on certain regular sets \\(E_u=(u,\\infty)^d\\). In this talk bounds and exact asymptotics of the probability \\(\\mathbb{P}\\{\\exists_{t \\in [0,T]}: GB(t)-ct \\in E_u\\}\\) for some set \\(E_u\\) are discussed. While \\(G\\) is a fixed non-singular matrix, the set \\(E_u\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) can be quite general and varies with the threshold \\(u\\). Our examples include balls and parabolic shapes. A new technical aspect of this talk is the connection with the results on Wiener sausage.

The decision maker seeks to maximize the expected reward she collects by including items in a knapsack while satisfying a capacity constraint, and while making terminal decisions as soon as each item weight is revealed. We propose a reoptimized heuristic and compare its total rewards with that of the optimal dynamic programming policy. We show that the two total rewards have the same asymptotic mean, the same asymptotic variance, and the same limiting distribution. In contrast, we also note that other asymptotically optimal heuristics that have been considered in the literature have different (larger) higher moments and different limiting distributions. Optimal Sparse Graph Design for Stochastic Matching Jiaming Xu (Duke University) The problem of designing sparse graphs to enable efficient stochastic matching arises in a variety of resource allocation and operations research contexts, including process flexibility and package delivery systems. Various graph families—such as K-chains and Erdős–Rényi random graphs—have been studied and shown to achieve strong performance. However, the question of what is the optimal graph design has remained open. In this paper, we resolve this question by proving that random regular graphs are asymptotically optimal. Goggin’s corrected Kalman Filter: Guarantees and Filtering Regimes Itai Gurvich (Northwestern University) In this paper we revisit a non-linear filter for non-Gaussian noises that was introduced by Goggin in 1992. Goggin proved that transforming the observations by the score function and then applying the Kalman Filter (KF) to the transformed observations results in an asymptotically optimal filter. In the current paper, we study the convergence rate of Goggin’s filter in a pre-limit setting that allows us to study a range of signal-to-noise regimes which includes, as a special case, Goggin’s setting. Our guarantees are explicit in the level of observation noise, and importantly, we do not assume Gaussianity of the noises. Our proofs build on combining simple tools from two separate literature streams. One is a general posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound for filtering. The other is convergence-rate bounds in the Fisher information central limit theorem. Along the way, we also study filtering regimes for linear state-space models, characterizing clearly degenerate regimes—where trivial filters are nearly optimal—and a balanced regime, which is where Goggin’s filter has the most value.

We explore an extension where the mixing is linked to the eigenvalues of the Gaussian covariance matrix, leading to multiple-scaled Gaussian mixture models - recently proposed for more flexible clustering and classification (see, e.g., \\([1-5]\\)). We further modify this framework to define a multivariate distribution uniquely determined by the underlying Gaussian covariance matrix. Key properties such as infinite divisibility and the related multivariate Lévy processes are discussed, highlighting their relevance in stochastic modeling. This is a joint work with Amos Natido.

Lévy processes with values in the cone of non-negatively defined matrices Krzysztof Podgórski (Podgorski) The infinite divisibility of the exponential distribution underlies the construction of the classical gamma Lévy motion. A natural generalization of the exponential distribution to the matrix-valued setting exists; however, it is not infinitely divisible and therefore cannot be directly used to define a matrix-valued gamma motion, see \\([3]\\). In existing literature, see \\([1]\\), the Lévy–Khintchine representation on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices has been employed to construct infinitely divisible matrix-valued analogues of gamma distributions. In this work, we propose three alternative approaches that yield distinct infinitely divisible distributions on the cone, while retaining the direct use of the natural matrix-valued exponential distribution. The first approach introduces a novel Lévy motion with multivariate argument and thus defined on the non-negative orthant, resulting in a multivariate shape (divisibility) parameter. This construction reveals a simple relationship with the classical matrix gamma distribution, which has a scalar shape parameter. The second and third constructions involve one-dimensional divisibility parameters and can be seen as natural matrix-valued extensions of the Bondesson shot-noise representation of the one-dimensional gamma motion, see \\([2]\\), where the matrix exponential distribution governs the jump sizes. Compared to prior constructions, the proposed models offer advantages such as explicit analytical expressions for many of their properties and straightforward simulation algorithms. These features make the models well-suited for applications in stochastic modeling, especially where stochastic integration is required and both theoretical analysis and computation must remain tractable.

Theory and Applications. Agnieszka Wyłomańska (Wrocław University of Science and Technology) Anomalous diffusion processes have been widely discussed in the literature. The process \\(\\{X(t)\\}\\) is labelled as anomalous diffusive if its second moment grows in time as a power-law function, i.e., \\[\\label{eq1} \\mathbb{E} \\left(X^2(t)\\right)=2Dt^{\\alpha} \\,,\\] where \\(\\alpha\\in[0,2]\\) is the anomalous exponent and \\(D\\in[0,\\infty)\\) is the generalized diffusion coefficient (called also diffusion coefficient). The classical example of the anomalous diffusive class is the fractional Brownian motion (FBM) \\(\\{B_{H}(t)~t\\geq 0\\}\\) that is continuous centred Gaussian process defined through the integral representation \\([1]\\) \\[\\tag{1} B_{H}(t) =A_{H}\\Bigg[\\int_{0}^{t}(t-u)^{H-1/2}d\\tilde{B}(u) +\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\mspace{-4mu}\\left((t-u)^{H-1/2}-(-u)^{H-1/2}\\right)d\\tilde{B}(u)\\Bigg] \\mspace{-4mu},\\] where \\(0&lt;H&lt;1\\) is the Hurst exponent. The process \\(\\{\\tilde{B}(t),~t\\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\\) is the extension of ordinary Brownian motion to the negative time axis defined as \\[\\tilde{B}(t)= \\begin{cases} B_1(t) ~ \\mbox{for}~t&gt;0,\\\\ B_2(-t) ~\\mbox{for}~ t\\leq 0, \\end{cases}\\] where \\(\\{B_1(t),~ t \\geq 0\\}\\) and \\(\\{B_2(t),~ t \\geq 0\\}\\) are two independent ordinary Brownian motions. Let us note that the Hurst exponent \\(H\\) determines the anomalous diffusion behavior of FBM and \\(\\alpha\\) in the equation \\((1)\\) is equal to \\(2H\\). However, recent empirical findings suggest that classical anomalous diffusion models often fail to adequately capture the underlying dynamics of such phenomena. Consequently, contemporary research has proposed numerous modifications to these models in order to better represent the specific behaviors observed in real data. One such modification involves the incorporation of random parameters that govern anomalous diffusion within traditional models. During the presentation, we introduce a novel conceptual approach to anomalous diffusion modeling, with a particular focus on FBM and its multifractional extension. In these models, the Hurst exponent \\(H\\) is replaced by a suitable randomly chosen variable \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) or a stochastic process \\(\\{\\mathcal{H}(t)\\}\\), respectively. We examine the fundamental probabilistic properties of the models discussed and discuss methodologies for their application to empirical data. The presentation concludes with several illustrative examples based on real-world datasets.

Free probability: Free probability, developed in large part by Voiculescu, is a theory of non-commuting random variables which can be used the describe the large-\\(n\\) behavior of certain \\(n \\times n\\) random matrices. The idea is that the algebra of classical random variables \\(L^\\infty(\\Omega,P)\\) is replaced by a non-commutative von Neumann algebra and the expectation is replaced by a tracial state \\(\\tau: M \\to \\mathbb{C}\\). The role of the normal distribution from classical probability is played by Wigner’s semicircular distribution, and classical independence is replaced by free independence, a condition motivated by free products of groups. In particular, a \\(d\\)-variable free Brownian motion is a process \\(S_t = (S_t^{(1)},\\dots,S_t^{(d)})\\) where the increments are freely independent and the different coordinates are also freely independent. A free Brownian motion describes the large-\\(n\\) behavior of a Brownian motion on the space \\(M_n(\\mathbb{C})_{\\operatorname{sa}}^d\\) of \\(d\\)-tuples of self-adjoint matrices. Stochastic optimization problems: We consider stochastic optimization problems that using both a free Brownian motion \\(S_t\\) and a classical Brownian \\(W_t\\); these processes are thus classical random objects taking values in a tracial von Neumann algebra, equipped with both classical and non-commutative filtrations. We consider processes satisfying \\[dX_t = \\beta_F dS_t + \\beta_C \\,dW_t + \\alpha_t\\,dt,\\] where \\(\\alpha_t\\) is a control that we want to choose. The stochastic optimization problem is \\[\\text{minimize } \\mathbb{E} [\\int_0^1 L(X_t,\\alpha_t)\\,dt + g(X_1)] \\text{ over } \\alpha,\\] where the running cost \\(L\\) and the terminal cost \\(g\\) are given functions that can be evaluated on non-commuting random variables. The inclusion of both \\(S_t\\) and \\(W_t\\) is motivated by mean field game theory (see \\([2]\\)): The \\(S_t\\) represents individual noise associated to a single player (motivated by the Brownian motion that affects all the matrix entries), and the \\(W_t\\) represents a common noise that affects all the players (which in the matrix model would be a random scalar multiple of the identity matrix added to each of the \\(d\\) matrices). Results: We study the value of the minimization problem as a function of the initial condition \\(X_0\\), and show that it satisfies a non-commutative version of the dynamic programming principle and Hamilton–Jacobi equation. A key challenge is that the value of the optimization problem may depend on the choice of ambient von Neumann algebra \\(M\\) and filtration. We thus take the infimum over all choices of \\(M\\) as well, and analyze how to join together different given choices of \\(M\\). However, under certain convexity assumptions, the answer is the same regardless of the choice of \\(M\\), and in this case we can show that the value of the free stochastic optimal problem gives the large-\\(n\\) limit of matrix optimal control problems. We remark that special cases of this setup relate closely with free entropy theory and the large deviation principle of Biane, Capitaine, and Guionnet \\([3]\\).

This connection can be used to prove annealed limit theorems for first passage times and maximal local times of the random walk by examining the growth of the associated branching process. I will focus on the model known as a random walk in a sparse random environment, in which the walker moves symmetrically apart from some randomly chosen sites where random drift is imposed. This model may be thought of as an interpolation between the simple symmetric random walk and a random walk in i.i.d. random environment, in which random drifts are put at all sites. We will see how the interplay between the drift and the sparsity of the environment affects the asymptotic properties of the walk.

Sapienza University of Rome) Random resistor networks are widely used in Physics to analyze transport in disordered systems, such as mixtures of conducting and non-conducting materials, doped semiconductors, and disordered superconductors. For a broad class of random geometries large-scale conduction can be described using deterministic coefficients derived from stochastic homogenization. Within this universal description, a material behaves as a conductor or an insulator depending on the statistical properties of macroscopic crossings in the resistor network. We will describe sufficient conditions for the emergence of macroscopic conduction. As an application, we will discuss Mott variable-range hopping in doped semiconductors in the low temperature regime which amplifies the effects of disorder, giving rise to the physics Mott’s law. Time permitting, we will also provide insights into universal laws for AC conduction via random electrical circuits and into the analysis of transport through stochastic interacting particle systems in random environments - moving beyond the mean-field approximation at the basis of random resistor networks. Keywords: percolation theory, random graphs, stochastic homogenization, interacting particle systems.

This talk considers the problem of estimating Fréchet means from an i.i.d. sample from \\(P\\), possibly contaminated by adversarial noise. The goal is to obtain optimal or-nearly optimal high probability bounds under weak moment assumptions on \\(P\\). Two main settings are considered. The first one consists of Alexandrov spaces where geodesics are “bi-extendible” in some precise quantitative sense, which is rich enough to include the space of probability measures over \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) with the Wasserstein-\\(2\\) distance. Our main theorem for this case refines an analysis of \\([1]\\), and obtains bounds with the “right” variance parameters The second setting we consider is that of uniformly convex Banach spaces of power type \\(2\\), where our results seem to be completely new.

In this talk, we review recent progress with respect to a class of reaction-diffusion stochastic particle systems on an \\(n\\)-dimensional lattice. In such a process, particles can move across sites as well as be created/annihilated according to diffusion and reaction rates. These rates will be chosen so that there are two preferred particle mass density levels \\(a_1\\), \\(a_2\\). In the evolution, one may understand, when the diffusion and reaction schemes are appropriately scaled, that a rough interface forms between the regions where the mass density is close to \\(a_1\\) or \\(a_2\\). Via notions in the theory of hydrodynamic limits, we discuss when the scaled limit of the particle mass density field in \\(n\\geq 2\\) is a sharp interface flow by mean-curvature.

Apart from their intrinsic interest, such surfaces are further motivated by connections with disordered spin systems, first-passage percolation models and minimal cuts in the Z^D lattice with random capacities. We wish to study the geometry of d-dimensional minimal surfaces in a (d+n)-dimensional random environment. Specializing to a model that we term harmonic MSRE, in an “independent\" or \"Brownian” random environment, we rigorously establish bounds on the geometric and energetic fluctuations of the minimal surface, as well as a scaling relation that ties together these two types of fluctuations. In particular, we prove, for all values of n, that the surfaces are delocalized in dimensions d ≤ 4 and localized in dimensions d ≥ 5. Moreover, the surface delocalizes with power-law fluctuations when d ≤ 3 and with sub-power-law fluctuations when d = 4. Many of our results are new even for d = 1 (indeed, even for d = n = 1), corresponding to the well-studied case of (non-integrable) first-passage percolation.

Considering continuous observation of the interacting particles over a fixed interval \\([0, T]\\), we examine the asymptotic regime as \\(N \\to \\infty\\). Our main tool is a random variable reminiscent of the least squares estimator but unobservable due to its reliance on the Skorohod integral. We demonstrate that this object is consistent and asymptotically normal by establishing a quantitative propagation of chaos for Malliavin derivatives, which holds for any \\(H \\in (0,1)\\). Leveraging a connection between the divergence integral and the Young integral, we construct computable estimators of the drift parameter. These estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically Gaussian. Finally, a numerical study highlights the strong performance of the proposed estimators. This is based on a joint work with I. Nourdin and R. Shevchenko. Adaptive minimax estimation for discretely observed Lévy processes Céline Duval (Sorbonne Université - LPSM) We study the nonparametric estimation of the density \\(f_\\Delta\\) of an increment of a Lévy process based on observations with a sampling rate \\(\\Delta\\). The class of Lévy processes considered is broad, including both processes with a Gaussian component and pure jump processes. A key focus is on processes where \\(f_\\Delta\\) is smooth for all \\(\\Delta\\). We use a spectral estimator of \\(f_\\Delta\\) and derive both upper and lower bounds, showing that the estimator is minimax optimal in both low- and high-frequency regimes. In low-frequency settings, we recover parametric convergence rates, while in high-frequency settings, we identify two regimes based on whether the Gaussian or jump components dominate. The rates of convergence are closely tied to the jump activity, with continuity between the Gaussian case and more general jump processes. This is based on a joint work with T. Jalal and E. Mariucci.

We impose that when the resulting surplus becomes negative the company has to decide whether to inject capital to get to a positive surplus level in order for the company to survive or to let ruin occur. The objective is to find the combined dividends and capital injections strategy that maximises the expected paid out dividends minus cost of injected capital, discounted at a constant rate, until ruin. We consider the setting where the cost of capital is level-dependent in the sense that it is higher when the surplus is below \\(0\\) than when it is above \\(0\\). We investigate optimality of a \\(3\\)-parameter strategy with parameters \\(-r &lt; 0 &lt; c &lt; b\\) where dividends are paid out to keep the surplus below \\(b\\), capital injections are made in order to keep the surplus above \\(c\\) unless capital drops below the level \\(-r\\) in which case the company decides to let ruin occur.

Valuation of multi-region CoCoCat bonds Krzysztof Burnecki (Wrocław University of Science and Technology) We introduce a novel, multidimensional insurance-linked instrument: a contingent convertible bond (CoCoCat bond) whose conversion trigger is activated by predefined natural catastrophes across multiple geographical regions. We develop such a model, explicitly accounting for the complex dependencies between regional catastrophe losses. Specifically, we explore scenarios ranging from complete independence to proportional loss dependencies, both with fixed and random loss amounts. Utilizing change-of-measure techniques, we derive risk-neutral pricing formulas tailored to these varied dependence structures. By fitting our model to real-world natural catastrophe data from Property Claim Services, we demonstrate the significant impact of inter-regional dependencies on the CoCoCat bond’s pricing, highlighting the importance of multidimensional risk assessment for this innovative financial instrument. Expectiles in probabilistic forecasting of electricity prices with risk management implications Joanna Janczura (Wrocław University of Science and Technology) We propose a new method for probabilistic forecasting of electricity prices. It is based on averaging point forecasts from different models combined with expectile regression. We show that deriving the predicted distribution in terms of expectiles, might be in some cases advantageous to the commonly used quantiles. Using expectile predictions as a future risk measure we propose a short-term diversification strategy for an electricity trader. The proposed methods are applied to the day-ahead electricity prices from the German market. The obtained results show that implementation of dynamic strategies based on expectiles improves the outcomes in terms of risk as well as profit.

Under mild assumptions, in the (most subtle) setting in which the mean drift in the interior is zero, we classify recurrence and transience and provide power-law bounds on tails of passage times; the classification depends on the interior covariance matrix, the (finitely many) drifts near the boundaries, and stationary distributions derived from two one-dimensional Markov chains associated to each of the two boundaries. As an application, we consider reflected random walks related to multidimensional variants of the Lindley process, for which no previous quantitative results on passage-times appear to be known. Based on joint work with Conrado da Costa and Mikhail Menshikov (Durham University). Persistence of Strongly Correlated Stationary Gaussian fields: From Universal Probability Decay to Entropic Repulsion Ohad Noy Feldheim (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) We study the persistence event (i.e., the event that the field remains positive on a large ball) for stationary Gaussian fields on \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) or \\(\\mathbb{Z}^d\\), whose correlation function is non-summable and asymptotically positively correlated (a spectral singularity at the origin). Firstly, we give precise log-asymptotics for the persistence probability in terms of capacity, expressed in terms of the order of the singularity at the origin. We then establish that the field conditioned to persist is propelled to height \\(C\\sqrt{\\log T}\\) and takes the shape of a deterministic function (the “equilibrium potential”). This generalises a classical result of Bolthausen, Deuschel and Zeitouni for the Gaussian free field (GFF) on \\(\\mathbb{Z}^d\\), \\(d \\ge 3\\), to a wide class of Gaussian fields with spectral singularity, showing that both the leading order of persistence probability decay and entropic repulsion are, in a sense, universal, depending only on the order of the spectral singularity.

Further, it covers the case where \\(u\\) is a modified solution of the FKPP equation.

In this talk, I will present one such example from the field of systems biology. We consider a stochastic model of the Michaelis-Menten (MM) enzyme kinetic reactions in terms of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) driven by Poisson Random Measures (PRMs). It has been argued that among various Quasi-Steady State Approximations (QSSAs) for the deterministic model of such chemical reactions, the total QSSA (tQSSA) is the most accurate approximation, and it is valid for a wider range of parameter values than the standard QSSA (sQSSA). While the sQSSA for this model has been rigorously derived from a probabilistic perspective at least as early as 2006 in Ball et al. (2006), a rigorous study of the tQSSA for the stochastic model appears missing. We fill in this gap by deriving it as a Functional Law of Large Numbers (FLLN), and also studying the fluctuations around this approximation as a Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT).

While existing results on regularization by such noise typically require Hölder continuity of the drift, we establish new strong existence and uniqueness results for certain classes of singular drifts, including discontinuous and highly irregular functions. More generally, we treat stochastic differential equations with additive noise given by a broader class of Volterra processes satisfying suitable kernel conditions, which, in addition to fractional Brownian motion, also includes the Riemann–Liouville process as a special case. Our approach relies on probabilistic arguments. This is a joint work with Maximilian Buthenhoff. Self-intersection local times of Volterra Gaussian processes in stochastic flows Olga Iziumtseva (University of Nottingham) Self-intersection local times of a random process are random variables that measure how much time the process spends in small neighborhoods of its self-intersection points. Being the geometric characteristics of nonsmooth random processes \\([1]\\), it found applications in studying of polymer models. Weighted self-intersection local times for a random process \\(x(t),\\ t\\in[0,1]\\) are formally defined as \\[T_k(\\rho)=\\int_{\\Delta_k}\\rho(x(t_1))\\prod^{k-1}_{i=1}\\delta_0(x(t_{i+1})-x(t_i))dt_1\\ldots dt_k,\\] where \\(\\Delta_k=\\{0\\leqslant t_1\\leqslant\\ldots \\leqslant t_k\\leqslant 1\\}\\), \\(\\rho\\) is a weight function and \\(\\delta_0\\) is the Dirac delta function at zero. To give a rigorous definition to the variable \\(T_k(\\rho)\\), it is natural to approximate the delta function and prove the existence of the limit. In this talk, we study multiple self-intersection local times for Volterra Gaussian processes in the stochastic flow generated by the equation with interaction introduced by A. Dorogovtsev in \\([2]\\) \\[\\begin{cases} du(t,x)=a(u(t,x),\\mu_t)dt+\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d}b(u(t,x),\\mu_t,z)W(dt,dz)\\\\ u(0,x)=x,\\ x\\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\\\ \\mu_t=\\mu_0\\circ u(t,\\cdot)^{-1}, \\end{cases}\\] where \\(W\\) is a Brownian sheet on \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\times [0,\\infty)\\) and \\(\\mu_0\\) is a probability measure on \\(\\mathbb{R}^d.\\) Firstly, for a class of weights we describe conditions on a general Gaussian process in \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) which guarantee the existence of its weighted self-intersection local times. Then, we define a class of Volterra Gaussian processes (i.e. Gaussian processes that admit the representation \\[x(t)=\\int^t_0k(t,s)dw(s),\\ t\\in[0,1]\\] with some Wiener process \\(w\\) and some square integrable Volterra kernel \\(k\\)), which suits required conditions. It allows us to check the existence of weighted self-intersection local times for this class of Volterra Gaussian processes. Finally, we apply the developed technique for a Volterra Gaussian process \\(x\\) evolving in the stochastic flow of interacting particles generated by the equation with interaction and prove the existence of multiple self-intrersection local times for the process \\(u(t,x(s)),\\ s\\in[0,1].\\) Bibliography \\([1]\\) J.-F.

Instead of analyzing second-order summary statistics like the Ripley K-function, one can estimate Bartlett’s spectral measure, also known in physics as the structure factor \\(S\\), which is the Fourier transform of the pair correlation function. Several estimators of \\(S\\) have been introduced \\([1, 2, 3]\\). However, without a reference minimax rate of convergence, it remains unclear whether better estimators could be constructed. We address this gap by proving the following minimax result: for estimating a structure factor of Hölder regularity \\(\\beta\\), the worst-case error of any estimator is at least the expected number of observed points raised to the power \\(-\\beta/(2\\beta + d)\\). We then construct multi-taper estimators that achieve this optimal rate and further show that they exhibit exponential concentration. These estimators are oracle in the sense that they depend on unknown parameters related to the smoothness of \\(S\\). To obtain a practical estimator, we propose a cross-validation method based on random thinning and decorrelation between distinct frequencies. Bibliography \\([1]\\) D. Hawat, G. Gautier, R.

Estimating the hyperuniformity exponent of point processes Bartlomiej Blaszczyszyn (Inria/ENS) Hyperuniformity characterizes random spatial structures whose large-scale variance grows more slowly than that of Poisson processes. First introduced in statistical physics by Torquato and Stillinger \\([1]\\), hyperuniform systems have attracted considerable attention due to their intermediate nature between perfect crystals, liquids, and glasses, and appears in a wide range of applications, from DNA organization and immune system dynamics to photoreceptor arrangements, urban planning, and cosmology. Detecting and quantifying hyperuniformity is essential across these diverse fields. Yet, statistical testing for hyperuniformity has only recently begun to develop. In joint work \\([2]\\), we address the problem of estimating the “strength” of hyperuniformity—formally, the exponent governing the decay of the spectral density near zero frequency—in a class of stationary point processes in Euclidean space. The key mathematical idea is that the variance of linear statistics, defined using smooth, rapidly decaying test functions, grows in a way that explicitly reflects this exponent. Using a multivariate central limit theorem for a family of such statistics, constructed from orthogonal functions at multiple scales (e.g., wavelets), we derive an asymptotically consistent estimator of the strength of hyperuniformity. This estimator can be computed from a single realization of the point process and comes with explicit confidence intervals. We validate this approach through simulations of various point process models and demonstrate its applicability on real data. We estimated the hyperuniformity exponent \\(\\alpha\\) for the Ginibre point process in two dimensions, using 75 Hermitian wavelets (\\(f_i\\)). This process is known to have an exponent of \\(\\alpha=2\\). The estimation result is shown on the left, and the point process itself (with 1600 points) on the right.

Conformal Novelty Detection for Replicate Point Patterns Christophe Biscio (University of Aalborg) Monte Carlo tests are widely used for computing valid p-values without requiring known distributions of test statistics. When performing multiple Monte Carlo tests, it is essential to maintain control of the type I error. Some techniques for multiplicity control pose requirements on the joint distribution of the p-values, for instance independence, which can be computationally intensive to achieve using naïve multiple Monte Carlo testing. We highlight in this work that multiple Monte Carlo testing is an instance of conformal novelty detection. Leveraging this insight enables a more efficient multiple Monte Carlo testing procedure, avoiding excessive simulations while still ensuring exact control over the false discovery rate or the family-wise error rate. We call this approach conformal multiple Monte Carlo testing. The performance is investigated in the context of global envelope tests for point pattern data through a simulation study and an application to a sweat gland data set. Results reveal that with a fixed number of simulations under the null hypothesis, our proposed method yields substantial improvements in power of the testing procedure as compared to the naïve multiple Monte Carlo testing procedure.

By NLBVPs, we refer to problems involving the heat equation in the domain with non-local operators at the boundary, such as Marchaud-type derivatives. In this case, Brownian motion tends to escape from the boundary via jumps, with each jump corresponding to the last jump of the subordinator associated with the non-local operator. In contrast, when Brownian motion is subject to Poissonian resetting, it is reset to the origin at exponentially distributed random times, leading to a concentration near the boundary. We show that these two dynamics are related when viewed through time reversal. Bibliography \\([1]\\) F.

Time-Changed spherical Brownian motions with drift and their anomalous behaviour Giacomo Ascione (Scuola Superiore Meridionale) Anomalous diffusions in \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) are characterized by a nonlinear relation between the mean-square displacement of the diffusing particles and the time-variable. It is clear, however, that this definition cannot be applied to diffusing particles in a compact Riemannian manifold. Even for the Brownian motion, while the linear character of the mean-square displacement is preserved for small times, the geometric properties of the considered domain clearly imposes an upper bound. As a consequence, one cannot recognize anomalous diffusions from standard ones by the observation of the asymptotic behaviour of the mean-square displacement. Nevertheless, even in \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\), one can recognize anomalous diffusions that exhibit a linear behaviour for small times, while deviating from this as time increases: hence, even the small-time asymptotic of the mean-square displacement could be not sufficient. In this talk, we introduce a prototype of anomalous diffusion on the sphere. Precisely, we will consider a spherical Brownian motion (possibly with a special drift described by a suitable vector field) time-changed by means of an independent inverse subordinator. These models were first considered (without drift) in \\([1,2,3]\\), while the drifted model has been described in \\([4]\\). We first study the inter-connection between such processes and some time-nonlocal Kolmogorov equations on the sphere. This is done by providing an explicit representation, in terms of spherical harmonics, of strong solutions of such equations when the initial data belongs to \\(H^s(\\mathbb{S}^2)\\) for some \\(s&gt;1\\), where \\(\\{H^s(\\mathbb{S}^2)\\}_{s \\in \\mathbb{R}}\\) is the Sobolev scale induced by the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the sphere. Thanks to this representation, we are able to show that such models still exhibit the same stationary/limit measure as the spherical Brownian motion (i.e., the uniform distribution on the sphere), but they converge to such a state in a non-exponential way. The latter phenomenon is called anomalous relaxation: we propose this characteristic to actually recognize anomalous diffusive behaviours on compact manifolds.

The talk is based on the joint work with Jean-Philippe Anker. Collisions in one-dimensional particle systems Nicole Hufnagel (Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf) In this joint work we consider a general one-dimensional particle system. These processes are mainly characterized by multiplicity parameters controlling the strength of the particles’ interaction. It is well-known that collisions between particles never take place when all of these multiplicities are large, but occur almost surely otherwise.     It was recently shown by the authors that the collision times in the special case of multivariate Bessel processes of rational type is a piecewise-linear function of the minimum of its multiplicities, but is independent of the dimension of the process’s domain. This implies that the Hausdorff dimension does not depend on the particle number.     In this talk, we present an approach to extend this result to a general particle system.

They can be seen as a superposition of sine and cosine waves with random amplitudes. This representation allows us to analyze the dependency between their frequencies. In this context, spectral density and spectral coherence serve as frequency domain analogs of covariance and correlation, respectively. In our research, we focus on harmonizable processes whose spectral measure is concentrated on a union of lines, potentially with non-unit slopes. This class of processes is a generalization of almost periodically correlated processes. It has practical applications in communication, particularly in the location of moving sources such as aircrafts, rockets, or hostile jamming emitters that transmit signals. First, we address the spectral density estimation problem. We propose a periodogram frequency-smoothed along the support line as its estimator. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the rescaled estimator. Consequently, we obtain the asymptotic distribution of the rescaled spectral coherence estimator. In addition, we introduce a subsampling technique designed specifically for the class of processes considered. We establish its consistency and construct subsampling-based confidence intervals for the spectral characteristics of harmonizable processes. To illustrate the theoretical results, we present a simulation study for models commonly used in acoustics and communication. Bibliography \\([1]\\) Dudek, A. E. and Majewski, B.

The proposed model consists of a superposition of cosines with a nonstationary phase shift process and a stationary amplitude process. The asymptotic properties of the first- and second-order moments of the considered process are investigated. Estimators of the asymptotic mean and autocovariance functions are introduced. The performance of the autocovariance function estimator is examined in a simulation study. Finally, the model is applied to a real biomedical dataset. Deep learning-based estimation of time-dependent parameters in the AR(1) model Agnieszka Kopeć (AGH University of Krakow) An autoregressive model of order 1 (AR(1)) is a simple yet widely used Markov process across various domains. In this talk, we consider the AR(1) model with time-varying parameters, which allows for greater flexibility in modeling real-world phenomena such as price dynamics, climate variability, financial market volatility, demand forecasting, and population dynamics. We propose a novel deep learning-based method for estimating the time-dependent parameters of the model by reformulating the problem as an optimization task. Our approach is grounded in the maximum likelihood framework, from which we derive an appropriate loss function for training the neural network. We validate our method through numerical experiments and, finally, demonstrate its practical relevance by applying it to a real-world energy price dataset.

In the most common setting, the trajectory of the polymer is given by a nearest-neighbour random walk path on the \\(d\\)-dimensional lattice, while the impurities (also called the environment) are given by a collection of i.i.d. centered random variables. In the recent years, there has been much focus on studying the scaling properties of the model around the critical point in spatial dimension \\(d=2\\). Remarkably, the work of F. Caravenna, R. Sun and N. Zygouras (Ann. Appl. Prob. 2017) showed that the log-partition function of the polymer converges in law to a normal distribution when considering disorder in the subcritical regime. In this talk, we present an alternative, yet more elementary, proof of this result which relies on an \\(L^2\\) decomposition of the partition function into the product of smaller-scale independent partition functions and central limit theorem arguments. This presentation is based on a joint work with Clément Cosco.

For real-valued random processes with exchangeable increments on \\([0, 1]\\), Kallenberg’s result \\([1]\\) provides a complete characterisation of these processes via another mixing relationship. Continuum random trees are random tree-like metric spaces that arise naturally as scaling limits of various models of discrete random trees. In this talk, we will focus in particular on two subclasses of continuum random trees: the so-called stable trees and inhomogeneous continuum random trees. An analogue of Kallenberg’s Theorem for continuum random trees first appeared as a claim in a paper \\([2]\\) by Aldous, Miermont and Pitman. They suggested that, in much the same way that a stable bridge process on \\([0, 1]\\) is a mixing of certain extremal exchangeable processes, stable trees are mixings of inhomogeneous continuum random trees. We present an outline of a rigorous argument supporting this claim, based on a novel construction that applies to both classes of trees. We will also briefly discuss some implications of this result on critical random graphs. The talk is based on the paper \\([3]\\).

"],["the-cutoff-phenomenon-for-markov-chains.html", "The cutoff phenomenon for Markov chains", " The cutoff phenomenon for Markov chains Justin Salez (Université Paris-Dauphine &amp; PSL) The cutoff phenomenon is an abrupt transition from out of equilibrium to equilibrium undergone by certain Markov processes in the limit where the size of the state space tends to infinity. Discovered four decades ago in the context of card shuffling, this surprising phenomenon has since then been observed in a variety of models, from random walks on groups or complex networks to interacting particle systems. It is now believed to be universal among fast-mixing high-dimensional processes. Yet, current proofs are heavily model-dependent, and identifying the general conditions that trigger a cutoff remains one of the biggest challenges in the quantitative analysis of finite Markov chains. In this talk, I will provide a self-contained introduction to this fascinating question, and then describe a recent partial answer based on entropy and curvature. Joint work with Francesco Pedrotti.
