In this plenary talk, we will explore recent advances in the quantitative analysis of mixing times and their applications in diverse areas. We provide a detailed discussion on various techniques used to bound the mixing time, including spectral gap methods, logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, and coupling arguments. Special emphasis will be given to the application of these techniques in the study of random walks on graphs, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and reversible vs. non-reversible chains. Theorem Let \\((X_t)_{t \\geq 0}\\) be a reversible Markov chain with transition matrix \\(P\\) and stationary distribution \\(\\pi\\). Define the total variation distance to stationarity as: \\[\\tag{1} d(t) = \\sup_{x} \\| P^t(x,\\cdot) - \\pi \\|_{TV}.\\] Then, under appropriate spectral conditions, the mixing time \\(t_{mix}(\\varepsilon)\\) satisfies the bound: \\[\\tag{2} t_{mix}(\\varepsilon) \\leq \\frac{1}{1 - \\lambda_2} \\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon},\\] where \\(\\lambda_2\\) is the second-largest eigenvalue of \\(P\\). Corollary For an ergodic, reversible Markov chain, if the spectral gap \\(1 - \\lambda_2\\) is bounded below by a positive constant, then \\(t_{mix}(\\varepsilon)\\) scales logarithmically in \\(1/\\varepsilon\\), ensuring rapid convergence to stationarity. These results have far-reaching applications in randomized algorithms, statistical sampling, and the analysis of large networks. We will conclude with a discussion of open problems and future directions in the study of mixing times. Bibliography 1. Levin, D. A., Peres, Y., &amp; Wilmer, E. L. (2009).

Random Graphs: Structure, Evolution, and Applications FirstName LASTNAME Affiliation FirstName LASTNAME Affiliation The study of random graphs has been a central topic in probability theory and combinatorics, with applications spanning network science, statistical physics, and theoretical computer science. In this plenary talk, we will explore fundamental results on the structural properties of random graphs and their dynamic evolution. A key focus will be on Erdős–Rényi random graphs \\(G(n, p)\\) and their phase transitions, highlighting threshold phenomena for connectivity, giant component formation, and graph coloring. We will also examine more advanced models such as preferential attachment graphs, which capture scale-free network behavior, and random geometric graphs used in spatial networks. Theorem For an Erdős–Rényi random graph \\(G(n, p)\\), the probability of the emergence of a giant component undergoes a sharp phase transition at \\(p = \\frac{1}{n}\\). More precisely: \\[\\tag{1} \\text{If } p &lt; \\frac{1}{n}, \\text{ all components are of order } O(\\log n).\\] \\[\\tag{2} \\text{If } p &gt; \\frac{1}{n}, \\text{ a unique giant component of order } \\Theta(n) \\text{ appears}.\\] Corollary For sufficiently large \\(n\\), the expected size of the largest component satisfies: \\[\\tag{3} \\mathbb{E}[C_1] \\sim \\begin{cases} (1 - \\lambda) n, &amp; p = \\frac{c}{n}, c &gt; 1,\\\\ O(\\log n), &amp; p = \\frac{c}{n}, c &lt; 1. \\end{cases}\\] We will also discuss real-world applications of random graph models, including social networks, epidemiology, and information spread in large-scale systems.

Entropy, Curvature, and Functional Inequalities in Stochastic Analysis FirstName LASTNAME Affiliation FirstName LASTNAME Affiliation Entropy methods have played a central role in stochastic analysis, particularly in the study of Markov diffusion processes, optimal transport, and functional inequalities. In this talk, we explore the interplay between entropy, Ricci curvature, and stochastic processes, focusing on the geometric structures underlying probability measures and their evolution. We analyze entropy functionals associated with stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their connection to Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we investigate the behavior of the entropy along solutions to stochastic evolution equations and establish new functional inequalities linking entropy, curvature, and mixing properties of diffusions. Theorem Let \\((M,g)\\) be a complete Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature bounded below by \\(K &gt; 0\\). Consider a diffusion process \\((X_t)_{t\\geq0}\\) on \\(M\\) governed by the generator \\(L = \\Delta - \\nabla V \\cdot \\nabla\\). Then, for the associated probability measure \\(\\mu_t\\) evolving according to the Fokker-Planck equation, we have the following entropy dissipation inequality: \\[\\tag{1} \\frac{d}{dt} H(\\mu_t | \\mu_\\infty) \\leq - 2K H(\\mu_t | \\mu_\\infty),\\] where \\(H(\\mu_t | \\mu_\\infty)\\) denotes the relative entropy with respect to the invariant measure \\(\\mu_\\infty\\). Corollary Under the same conditions, the measure \\(\\mu_t\\) converges exponentially fast to \\(\\mu_\\infty\\) in relative entropy: \\[\\tag{2} H(\\mu_t | \\mu_\\infty) \\leq H(\\mu_0 | \\mu_\\infty) e^{-2Kt}.\\] This result provides an explicit entropy-based convergence rate for diffusion processes in positively curved spaces. These findings have implications for gradient flow techniques, large deviations, and information geometry, offering a deeper understanding of the role of entropy in stochastic analysis.

Entropy, Stochastic Flows, and Log-Sobolev Inequalities FirstName LASTNAME Affiliation FirstName LASTNAME Affiliation In recent years, entropy methods have been successfully applied to study the behavior of stochastic flows and their geometric properties. This talk explores new developments in entropy techniques in relation to log-Sobolev inequalities, Wasserstein geometry, and the long-time behavior of stochastic processes. We establish novel connections between entropy production, Ricci curvature lower bounds, and contraction properties of stochastic flows. In particular, we derive entropy-based criteria for the exponential convergence of solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in the Wasserstein space. Theorem Let \\((X_t)_{t\\geq0}\\) be a stochastic flow on a Riemannian manifold \\((M,g)\\) with generator \\(L = \\Delta - \\nabla V \\cdot \\nabla\\). Assume the Bakry-Émery curvature-dimension condition \\(CD(K,N)\\) holds for some \\(K&gt;0\\). Then, for any probability measure \\(\\mu_t\\) evolving under the associated Fokker-Planck equation, the entropy satisfies: \\[\\tag{1} H(\\mu_t | \\mu_\\infty) \\leq H(\\mu_0 | \\mu_\\infty) e^{-Kt},\\] where \\(H(\\mu_t | \\mu_\\infty)\\) denotes the relative entropy with respect to the invariant measure \\(\\mu_\\infty\\). Corollary Under the same conditions, the stochastic flow exhibits exponential contraction in the Wasserstein-2 metric: \\[\\tag{2} W_2(\\mu_t, \\mu_\\infty) \\leq W_2(\\mu_0, \\mu_\\infty) e^{-Kt}.\\] These results provide new insights into the role of entropy in the stability and regularity of stochastic dynamical systems.

"],["random-matrices-and-number-theory.html", "IS2: Random Matrices and Number Theory", " IS2: Random Matrices and Number Theory Random Matrix Models and their Applications in Number Theory Tags: Random Matrices, Number Theory FirstName LASTNAME Affiliation FirstName LASTNAME Affiliation Random matrix theory (RMT) has emerged as a powerful tool in number theory, providing deep insights into the statistical behavior of zeta functions, L-functions, and arithmetic properties of primes. In this talk, we will explore recent developments in the interplay between random matrices and number theory, focusing on universality properties, eigenvalue distributions, and connections to the Riemann zeta function. One of the central themes of this discussion is the remarkable analogy between the eigenvalue statistics of random matrices from classical compact groups and the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. We present new results on the correlation functions of eigenvalues in ensembles such as the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) and their implications for the distribution of L-function zeros. Theorem Let \\(H_N\\) be an \\(N \\times N\\) random Hermitian matrix drawn from the GUE. Then, the limiting distribution of eigenvalues follows the Wigner semicircle law: \\[\\tag{1} \\rho_N(\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\sqrt{2N - \\lambda^2}, \\quad |\\lambda| \\leq \\sqrt{2N}.\\] Moreover, under appropriate scaling, the local eigenvalue statistics converge to the sine-kernel distribution observed in the zeros of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line. Corollary The pair correlation function of the normalized zeros of the Riemann zeta function matches that of GUE eigenvalues: \\[\\tag{2} R_2(s) = 1 - \\frac{\\sin^2(\\pi s)}{(\\pi s)^2},\\] indicating strong statistical similarities between random matrices and number-theoretic objects. These results provide further evidence for the conjectured link between RMT and the distribution of prime numbers, with applications extending to quantum chaos and mathematical physics.

Moments of L-Functions and Random Matrix Models Tags: Random Matrices FirstName LASTNAME Affiliation FirstName LASTNAME Affiliation The study of moments of L-functions is a central problem in analytic number theory, closely related to the distribution of prime numbers and deep conjectures such as the Riemann Hypothesis. In recent years, random matrix theory (RMT) has provided compelling models for predicting the asymptotic behavior of these moments. In this talk, we explore new results on the connection between RMT and number theory, focusing on the moments of the Riemann zeta function and families of L-functions. We examine the conjectural asymptotics of moments of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line and compare them with predictions from the characteristic polynomial of random unitary matrices. Specifically, we analyze the behavior of the \\(2k\\)-th moment: \\[\\tag{1} M_k(T) = \\int_0^T |\\zeta(1/2 + it)|^{2k} dt,\\] and show its connection to random matrix eigenvalue statistics. Theorem For \\(k=1\\), the leading order asymptotic of \\(M_k(T)\\) satisfies: \\[\\tag{2} M_1(T) \\sim T \\log T.\\] For larger \\(k\\), conjectures suggest that: \\[\\tag{3} M_k(T) \\sim c_k T (\\log T)^{k^2},\\] where \\(c_k\\) is a constant predicted by RMT. Corollary The statistical behavior of moments of L-functions matches that of the characteristic polynomials of matrices from the Circular Unitary Ensemble (CUE), further strengthening the RMT-number theory correspondence. We discuss the implications of these results for the study of the zeros of L-functions, connections to random matrix eigenvalue statistics, and possible refinements of moment conjectures.

The Distribution of Eigenvalues in Random Matrix Models and Number-Theoretic Implications Tags: Random Matrices FirstName LASTNAME Affiliation FirstName LASTNAME Affiliation Random matrix theory (RMT) has proven to be an essential tool in understanding fundamental problems in number theory, particularly in the study of the distribution of zeros of L-functions and related arithmetic objects. This talk will explore recent advances in the statistical properties of eigenvalues in random matrix ensembles and their implications for number theory. We focus on the connection between the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), and the distribution of low-lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function and families of L-functions. In particular, we examine the local spacing statistics of these zeros and their resemblance to eigenvalues of large random matrices. Theorem Let \\(M_N\\) be an \\(N \\times N\\) random Hermitian matrix from the GUE. The scaled eigenvalue spacing distribution converges to the sine kernel: \\[\\tag{1} P(s) = \\frac{\\sin^2(\\pi s)}{(\\pi s)^2},\\] which matches the pair correlation function of the normalized zeros of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line. Corollary The statistical properties of low-lying zeros of L-functions in a given family follow the same universal laws as eigenvalues of random matrix ensembles, providing strong evidence for the random matrix conjectures in number theory. We will also discuss the broader implications of these results in analytic number theory, including conjectures on the distribution of primes and higher moments of L-functions. Bibliography 1.

The guiding principle is that for a Dirichlet form \\(\\mathcal E\\) on \\(L^2(X,dx)\\) with generator \\(\\mathcal L\\) and (nonnegative, superharmonic) function \\(h&gt;0\\), \\(\\mathcal L h\\le 0\\), we have \\[\\mathcal E(u,u)\\ge \\int \\frac{-\\mathcal L h}{h} u^2\\] for functions \\(u\\) in the domain of \\(\\mathcal E\\), see \\[1\\].
